# Blue-Green-demo

• A Blue-Green Deployment is a deployment strategy where two identical environments, the “blue” environment and the “green” environment, are set up. The blue environment is the production environment, where the live version of the application is currently running, and the green environment is the non-production environment, where new versions of the application are deployed.

• When a new version of the application is ready to be deployed, it is deployed to the green environment. Once the new version is deployed and tested, traffic is switched to the green environment, making it the new production environment. The blue environment then becomes the non-production environment, where future versions of the application can be deployed.

## Benefits of Blue-Green Deployments

• Zero Downtime: Blue-Green Deployments allow new versions of applications to be deployed with zero downtime, as traffic is switched from the blue environment to the green environment seamlessly.

• Easy Rollback: If a new version of the application has issues, rolling back to the previous version is easy, as the blue environment is still available.

• Reduced Risk: By using Blue-Green Deployments, the risk of deploying new versions of applications is reduced significantly. This is because the new version can be deployed and tested in the green environment before traffic is switched over from the blue environment. This allows for thorough testing and reduces the chance of issues arising in production.

• Increased Reliability: By using Blue-Green Deployments, the reliability of the application is increased. This is because the blue environment is always available, and any issues with the green environment can be quickly identified and resolved without affecting users.

• Flexibility: Blue-Green Deployments provide flexibility in the deployment process. Multiple versions of an application can be deployed side-by-side, allowing for easy testing and experimentation.
